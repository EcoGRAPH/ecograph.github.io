### Research Interests
Dr. Mike Wimberly is a Professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Oklahoma and the head of the EcoGRAPH research group. His research combines ecological models with earth observation data to address critical research questions and create practical applications in the fields of public health and natural resources management. Dr. Wimberly has led multiple NASA- and NIH-funded research projects on infectious disease forecasting, resulting in the development of novel geoinformatics platforms that use satellite remote sensing to predict West Nile virus outbreaks in the United States and malaria in the highlands of East Africa. He has also built a satellite-based monitoring system to track forest degradation in tropical West Africa and developed spatial simulation models to project future landscapes under alternative scenarios of global change. To carry out these projects, I apply my programming expertise in multiple languages, including C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. In particular, I use the R language and environment extensively for data processing and modeling, and I have more than a decade of experience developing and delivering high-quality R training through university courses and workshops.


He integrates ecological concepts with the application of satellite remote sensing, geographic information science, and spatial statistics to study environmental change and its effects on hosts, vectors, pathogens, and human disease at landscape to continental scales. His current projects focus on the identification of environmental risk factors for outbreaks of human West Nile virus disease in the United States and epidemic malaria in the highlands of East Africa. The results of this work are being used to develop improved tools for forecasting and mapping the risk of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Dr. Wimberly has also studied the influences of climate and land cover on geographic distributions of emerging tick-borne zoonoses, explored the contextual effects of natural amenities on physical activity and the prevalence of obesity, and conducted research on the causes and consequences of land cover and land use change in multiple regions of the world.
