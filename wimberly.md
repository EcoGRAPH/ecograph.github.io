# Dr. Michael C. Wimberly
## Professor, Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability, University of Oklahoma

### Education
- B.A., Environmental Science, University of Virginia
- M.S., Quantitative Resource Management, University of Washington
- Ph.D., Forest Ecology, Oregon State University

### Research Interests
Dr. Mike Wimberly is a Professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Oklahoma and the head of the EcoGRAPH research group. His research combines ecological models with earth observation data to address research questions and create practical applications in the fields of public health and natural resource management. He studies the interactions between wildfire and vegetation dynamics in temperate and tropical forest ecosystems, agricultural expansion and the resulting fragmentation of native forests and grasslands, and the effects of land use and climate  on vector-borne disease transmission. Dr. Wimberly has applied the results of his research to build novel geoinformatics platforms that use satellite remote sensing to predict West Nile virus outbreaks in the United States and malaria in the highlands of East Africa. He has also created a satellite-based monitoring system to track forest degradation in tropical West Africa and developed spatial simulation models to project future landscapes under scenarios of global change.
