# Dr. Michael C. Wimberly

### Education
- B.A., Environmental Science, University of Virginia
- M.S., Quantitative Resource Management, University of Washington
- Ph.D., Forest Ecology, Oregon State University

### Research Interests
Dr. Mike Wimberly is a Senior Scientist in the Geospatial Sciences Center of Excellence and a professor of Natural Resource Management at South Dakota State University. His research explores the patterns and drivers of land use and land cover dynamics, the ecological impacts of changing climates and landscapes, and the implications of these changes for ecosystem services and human health. Specific topics include the environmental determinants of mosquito-borne diseases, interactions between human populations and wildfires in the western United States, the effects of land use change, logging, and fire on tropical forests in West Africa, and the ecological impacts of agricultural extensification in the Great Plains. Dr. Wimberly applies the results from these studies to develop decision-support tools for public health and natural resource management. Examples include the EPIDEMIA early warning system for predicting malaria epidemics in the Ethiopian highlands, the SDMIS system for forecasting West Nile virus outbreaks in South Dakota, and the CHANGE model for simulating interactions between land use change, forest management activities, and wildfires.
