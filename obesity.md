## Project Description

The increasing prevalence of obesity in the United States has been influenced by environmental factors that discourage physical activity and limit the availability of healthy foods. Most research on these phenomena has taken place in metropolitan areas, focusing on the effects of suburban sprawl on physical activity and the lack of supermarket access in impoverished urban areas. However, the high prevalence of obesity in rural areas highlights a need for additional research outside of major metropolitan regions. Whereas cities and suburbs are dominated by the built environment, the character of rural landscapes is molded by the natural environment, which influences the social and economic characteristics of rural communities and ultimately the health of rural populations. The overarching goal of this research was to test multiple working hypotheses about the environmental drivers of obesity, with an emphasis on the contrasts between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas within the conterminous United States.

We used spatial statistics to analyze data county-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and identify clusters of high and low obesity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and physical activity in the conterminous United States. In major metropolitan areas, counties with high densities of supermarkets and full-service restaurants had lower obesity prevalence than counties dominated by convenience stores and fast-food restaurants. We found that increased distance from supermarkets was associated with high obesity prevalence in metropolitan counties, but not in more rural, non-metropolitan areas. In these non-metropolitan counties, we found that abundant natural amenities and recreational opportunities were associated with low obesity prevalence and high rates of physical activity. Overall, these results highlighted strong geographic variation in obesity and associated risk factors within the United States, but also showed that the environmental determinants of these patterns are different in urban versus rural contexts. To be effective, public health interventions focused on reducing obesity, improving diet, and encouraging physical activity should be tailored to the unique social, cultural, and physical factors of different geographic locations.
