## Project Description

Our main goals are to understand the processes that maintain resilience of tropical forests in the face of changing climates and increasing land use pressures, and to predict where forests have the highest risk of future degradation and loss. We address these goals by using satellite remote sensing to monitor and analyze historical changes in forest conditions and fire regimes, and by using landscape simulation models to project the impacts of future environmental change scenarios.
