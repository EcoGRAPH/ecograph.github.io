## Project Description

The prairies of North America are among the most threatened terrestrial ecosystem on the continent. In particular, increasing demands for corn and soybean production have led to subtantial conversion of grasslands to row crop agriculture at the western edge of the U.S. Corn Belt in North and South Dakota. Much of this change is occuring within the Prairie Pothole Region, which has a high density of shallow wetlands and provides critical habitat for numerous migratory bird species. Grasslands provide critical ecosystem services, including the maintenance of diverse pollinator communities, long-term carbon sequestration, prevention of soil and nutrient loss, and protection of water quality. Loss and fragmentation of grassland cover reduces the amount and quality of habitat for a variety of species including amphibians, butterflies and birds. Cropland expansion also results in extensive wetland drainage and loss of habitat for wetland-associated species. Therefore, current trends of land use and land cover change have raised subtantial concerns over the threats to native species and ecosystems.

Given these threats, there is a need for more precise geospatial information about the amounts and spatial patterns of forest degradation along with projections of the likely effects of future climate and land use change. However, detecting the subtle changes associated with degradation presents a challenge for forest monitoring with satellite remote sensing. To address this challenge, we have developed the West Africa Forest Degradation Dataset (WAForDD), which uses all available imagery from the 18-year archive of Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery in West Africa. We apply time series analysis to detect gradual forest degradation and recovery as well as sudden deforestation events. Our team is working with partners at the University of Ghana and the Forestry Commission of Ghana to derive annual estimates of emissions from degradation to in support or measurement, reporting, and validation for Ghana's REDD+ program.
