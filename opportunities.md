### Postdoc in Remote Sensing of Environment Change
The EcoGRAPH group in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability (DGES) at the University of Oklahoma is looking for a postdoctoral research associate to join our team. This individual will work on one or more of our current research projects. Topics include the effects of urban land use change on microclimate and habitat suitability for mosquito-borne disease transmission, and the influences of climate change on degradation and fire susceptibility of African tropical forests. The postdoc may work in one or both of these areas depending on their interests and expertise. They will have opportunities to contribute to development of the research methodology and to extend the work to address new questions. 

A Ph.D. and research experience with geospatial data analysis and satellite remote sensing. The Ph.D. must be completed before starting the position. The desired candidate would have strong writing and communication skills combined with programming experience using relevant platforms such as R, Python, or the Google Earth Engine API. This position is available beginning in September 2023, although a later start date is negotiable. To apply, please send a letter of interest, CV, and contact information for three references to Dr. Mike Wimberly at mcwimberly@ou.edu. Review of applications will begin after August 31 2023 and will continue until the position is filled. Feel free to send Dr. Wimberly an email first if you have questions about the position.

Candidates from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented demographics are encouraged to apply. The University of Oklahoma is committed to achieving a diverse, equitable, and inclusive university community by embracing each person's unique contributions, background and perspectives. Fostering an inclusive environment for all, with particular attention to the needs of historically marginalized populations, is vital to the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of our institutional mission. This enhances the OU experience for all students, faculty and staff and for the communities we engage. 

### Graduate Students
The Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability accepts application for fall admission every year, and applications are typically due in mid-January. See this [announcement](https://www.ou.edu/content/dam/AGS/geography/docs/DGES_ad_for_Fall2022_Final.pdf) for more information.

Dr. Wimberly advises graduate students in Geography and Environmental Sustainability who are interested in pursuing research on environmental change and its impacts on disease transmission and human and animal health. Most of the work we do is highly interdisciplinary and falls under the rubric of emerging fields such as GeoHealth, One Health, and Planetary Health. Specific areas of expertise include the effects of climate and land use on vector-borne pathogens and forest landscape dynamics in temperature and tropical ecosystems. The research conducted by our group also encompasses a broader range of topics related to land use and land cover change as well as health geography. Prospective graduate students should have strong interest in one of these areas with relevant coursework or professional experience. Much of our work involves processing and analyzing large geospatial datasets, and skill with computer programming is essential for these tasks. 

Students who are interested in graduate study in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability should visit the department's [Graduate Programs](https://www.ou.edu/ags/geography/degree-programs/graduate-program) page for more information. Funding is sometimes available through graduate research assistantships (GRA), which are typically associated with research grants. If a GRA is available, we will put out a specific announcement to recruit applicants for that position. Funding is also  available through a limited number of graduate teaching assistant (GTA) positions that are offered by the department. Selection of GTAs is a competitive process that is conducted at the department level. To be considered for GTA funding, the submission deadlines are January 15 for the next fall semester and September 1 for the next spring semester. Students who are interested in studying with Dr. Wimberly should submit an inquiry well in advance of these dates. Send a statement of research interests, CV, and copies of transcripts to Dr. Mike wimberly at mcwimberly@ou.edu.
