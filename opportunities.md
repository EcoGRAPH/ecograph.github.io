### Postdoc Position (Applications Currently Being Accepted)
The EcoGRAPH group is looking for a postdoctoral research associate to join our team. This individual will work on an exciting new research project on urban microenvironments and disease transmission in India, supported for three years by an R01 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The research will include analyses of urban settlement patterns and their changes in the Gujarat region of India. The resulting data will be used to predict variation in mosquito habitats and microclimates and linked to epidemiological models of malaria transmission risk. The postdoc will have opportunities to contribute to development of the research methodology and to extend the work to address new questions. 

A Ph.D. and research experience with geospatial data analysis and modeling is required. The Ph.D. must be completed before starting the position. The desired candidate would have strong writing and communication skills combined with programming experience using relevant platforms such as R, Python, or the Google Earth Engine API. Experience working with satellite Earth observations combined with a strong interest in studying vector-borne disease ecology in urban systems is also desired. This position is available as early as January 1, 2022, although a later start date is negotiable, and will remain open until filled. To apply, please send a letter of interest, CV, and contact information for three references to Dr. Mike Wimberly at mcwimberly@ou.edu. Feel free to send an email first if you have questions about the position.

Candidates from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented demographics are encouraged to apply. The University of Oklahoma is committed to achieving a diverse, equitable, and inclusive university community by embracing each person's unique contributions, background and perspectives. Fostering an inclusive environment for all, with particular
attention to the needs of historically marginalized populations, is vital to the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of our institutional mission. This enhances the OU experience for all students, faculty and staff and for the communities we engage. The Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability recently completed a cluster hire focused on sustainability and equity, and has made a commitment to pursue transdisciplinary scholarship in this area.

### Graduate Students
Dr. Wimberly advises graduate students in Geography and Environmental Sustainability who are interested in pursuing research on environmental change and its impacts on disease transmission and human and animal health. Most of the work we do is highly interdisciplinary and falls under the rubric of emerging fields such as GeoHealth, One Health, and Planetary Health. Specific areas of expertise include the effects of climate and land use on vector-borne pathogens and forest landscape dynamics in temperature and tropical ecosystems. The research conducted by our group also encompasses a broader range of topics related to land use and land cover change as well as health geography. Prospective graduate students should have strong interest in one of these areas with relevant coursework or professional experience. Much of our work involves processing and analyzing large geospatial datasets, and skill with computer programming is essential for these tasks. 

Student who are interested in graduate study in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability should visit the department's [Graduate Programs](https://www.ou.edu/ags/geography/degree-programs/graduate-program) page for more information. Funding is sometimes available through graduate research assistantships (GRA), which are typically associated with research grants. If a GRA is available, we will put out a specific announcement to recruit applicants for that position. Funding is also  available through a limited number of graduate teaching assistant (GTA) positions that are offered by the department. Selection of GTAs is a competitive process that is conducted at the department level. To be considered for GTA funding, the submission deadlines are January 15 for the next fall semester and September 1 for the next spring semester. Students who are interested in studying with Dr. Wimberly should submit an inquiry well in advance of these dates. Send a statement of research interests, CV, and copies of transcripts to Dr. Mike wimberly at mcwimberly@ou.edu.
