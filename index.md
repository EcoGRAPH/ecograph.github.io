The EcoGRAPH research team is part of the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Oklahoma. Our research explores the patterns and drivers of land use and land cover dynamics, the ecological impacts of changing climates and landscapes, and the implications of these changes for ecosystem services and human health. We address these topics through landscape, regional, and global analyses using satellite remote sensing and other sources of environmental monitoring data. Specific topics include the environmental determinants of mosquito-borne diseases, interactions between human populations and wildfires in the western United States, the effects of land use and climate change on tropical forests in West Africa, and the ecological impacts of agricultural expansion in the Great Plains. We apply the results from these studies to develop decision-support tools for public health and natural resource management. Examples include the EPIDEMIA early warning system for predicting malaria epidemics in the Ethiopian highlands, the ArboMAP system for forecasting West Nile virus outbreaks in South Dakota, and the CHANGE model for simulating the effects of land use, forest management, and fire on forest landscape dynamics.
