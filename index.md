The EcoGRAPH research team is in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Oklahoma. Our research explores the impacts of changing climate and landscapes on ecosystem and human health, with an emphasis on developing spatial decision support tools to support public health decisions, land use planning, and natural resource management. We address these topics through landscape, regional, and global analyses using satellite remote sensing and other sources of environmental monitoring data. Specific research areas include the effects of environmental change on vector-borne disease outbreaks, the influences of human land use and wildfires on forest landscape dynamics, the ecological impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification, and the development of computer software for disease outbreak forecasting and landscape change modeling. We conduct our research in a variety of locations of the throughout the world including North America, tropical West Africa, and the Ethiopian highlands.
