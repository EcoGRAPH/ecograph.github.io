The EcoGRAPH research team is part of the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Oklahoma. Our research explores the patterns and drivers of land use and land cover dynamics, the ecological impacts of changing climates and landscapes, and the implications of these changes for ecosystem and human health. We address these topics through landscape, regional, and global analyses using satellite remote sensing and other sources of environmental monitoring data. Specific topics of interest include the effects of environmental change on vector-borne disease outbreaks, the influences of human land use and fire on forest landscape dynamics, the ecological impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification, and the development of computer software for disease outbreak forecasting and landscape change modeling. We conduct our research in a variety of locations of the throughout the world including North America, tropical West Africa, and the Ethiopian highlands.
