# Andrews Korah
## Postdoctoral Research Associate
## Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability, University of Oklahoma

### Education
- Ph.D., Geography and Environmental Sustainability, University of Oklahoma
- M.A., Geography, Miami (OH) University

### Research Interests
Andrews Korah is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Geography and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Oklahoma. His research employs mixed-methods, machine learning, GIS, urban growth models, and satellite Earth observations to address questions about urbanization dynamics and their impacts on people and the environment. Areas of focus include tree cover and urbanization, temperature dynamics in cities, urban growth projections, drivers of urban sprawling and infilling across different-sized cities. Dr. Korah has developed an impervious dataset to monitor urban expansion in rapidly urbanizing hotspots in West Africa, and projected future urban expansion across Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria.
