## Project Description

West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the United States and poses a persistent threat to public health in many parts of the country. We have conducted research on WNV in the Northern Great Plains to explore the environmental risk factors that influence transmission to humans. The spatial and temporal distributions of the vector mosquitoes and bird hosts, and consequently the risk of disease in humans, are strongly influenced by temperature, humidity, vegetation, soils, and land use. These relationships can be quantified using mathematical models and applied to develop maps of WNV risk and forecast the probability of future outbreaks. We have used these results to develop a WNV early warning system that combines information from gridded meterological data with mosquito surveillance to produce weekly maps of WNV risk during the transmission season. This work is supported in part by a grant from the NASA Applied Sciences Public Health and Air Quality Program (NNX15AF74G).
